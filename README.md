---

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/code-server-bash-installer.git
cd code-server-bash-installer
```

Make the script executable (optional):

```bash
chmod +x main.sh
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the script:

```bash
bash main.sh
```

or:

```bash
./main.sh
```

---

## 🔐 Default Login

- URL: http://localhost:8080
- Password: `replit123`

⚠️ **Important:** Change the password in `main.sh` before deploying publicly.

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Change Version
```bash
VERSION="3.9.3"
```

### Change Port
```bash
./code-server --bind-addr 0.0.0.0:8080
```

### Authentication
```bash
--auth password   # password authentication
--auth none       # disable authentication
```

---

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- Do NOT expose this publicly without changing the password
- Use HTTPS (reverse proxy) for production
- Replit already provides authentication — consider `--auth none`
